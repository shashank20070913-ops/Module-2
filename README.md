# *Iterative Statements: Palindrome Number Checker*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program that checks whether a given number is a palindrome using loops.

_ALGORITHM:_

Get input from the user and assign it to a variable num.
Assign the value of num to a temporary variable temp.
Initialize a variable rev to 0 (used to store the reversed number).
Use a while loop to reverse the digits:
While temp > 0:
rev = (10 * rev) + temp % 10
temp = temp // 10
After the loop, compare rev with num:
If equal, print that the number is a palindrome.
Else, print that it is not a palindrome.

# *Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

_ALGORITHM:_

Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
Print the result.

# *Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum.

_ALGORITHM:_

Get two integer inputs from the user.
Use a lambda function to define a function f that returns a + b.
Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

_PROGRAM:_

_RESULT:_
Thus , the program has been executed succesfully.

# *Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator.

_ALGORITHM:_

Define a function called result that takes two arguments a and b.
Inside the function, compute the modulo using a % b.
Print the result of the modulo operation.
Get two integer inputs from the user.
Call the result function with the user-provided values.
